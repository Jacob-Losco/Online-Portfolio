Project - Online Portfolio

    GOAL:
        Make a front end for displaying my projects, as well as give a window for people to contact me.
            Link this in resume

    STATUS:
        LRD:
            The front end is close to completion, with some touching up to do in the home and project pages.
            Database is connected, and sends data to the front end efficiently.
            There are still some unknowns about how to deploy

    ACTION:
        complete the front end
        research methods of deployment and narrow to a few choices.

    FUTURE DECISIONS:
        (main website + mailer) - determine whether or not to have a seperate route for contact pages between the online portfolio and the personal website.
